# Configuration files

## Vim
.vimrc file and some snippets for snipmate.vim in the snippets directory.
## i3
Minor i3 configs and some binaries for toogling sound etc.
## cheatsheet
Cheatsheets for commands I tend to forget, I save them here instead of googling them.
## Zsh
.zshrc file for my zsh settings.

# Installation
Run ./install.sh [opt install path]

The script sets up vim and zsh into the install path, the install path defaults into the current users home dir.
